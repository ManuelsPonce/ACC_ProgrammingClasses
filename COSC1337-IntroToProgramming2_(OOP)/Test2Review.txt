----TEST 2 REVIEW----
  ****CH. 7-9****

1)c++ member function that changes or stores a value a value: Setters or Mutators
2)retreaves the values from member functions: Accessors or Gettersin 
3)In a class you can have a member variable that is actually an instance of another class: Object Composition pg. 442
4)a constructor has to have the same name as: The class
5)What does a destructor do?: Called at the end ofa scope to destroyed the object and deallocate the memory
6)algorithm that arranges some data: sorting algorithm 
7)searching algorithm: looka for some data
8)member function that can only be called from a function that is a memberof the class: private functions
9)2 sorts: Bubble and selection sorts. Selection is more efficient, easy to implament
10)2 searches: bianary and linear, bianary is way more efficient but only if data is ordered 
11)Display contents of an array: iterate with a for loop, printing the array will print the array memory adress
12)how to create an instence of an object
13)Objects create permit data holding can keep functions outside the class from knowing the names of the variables holding the data: all of the above
14)operator to invoke a public function for a class: dot operator
15)how do you referencde individual elements of an array: index or subscript, starts with zero base indexing
16)advantage of a linear search: data doesnt have to be ordered and it is simple
17)boundling of an objects data and procedures: encapsulation
18)implicit array sizing: put empty brackets when initiating the array with curly braces and the amount of elements inside is the sizing
19)linear search of 1000 elements: 1000 comparisons
20)what kind of structure doyou usually use to process an array: a for loop
21)T/F - a binary search requires elements in ordered: True
22)T/F - A class decleration provides a pattern for creating objects, so when a class is created, it automatically creates an object: False, needs an instance
23)T/F - A one dimentional array can be initialized at the time it is difined but a two dementional array cannot: False
24)T/F - A one dimentional arrat can only store elements of a single data type but a two dimentional array can store elements of two type: false 
25)T/F - An individual array element can be processed or passed to a function lieka normal variable: true
26)T/F - c++ allows arrays to have two or more dimentions: True
27)T/F Object oriented programming is centered around both data and funcions that operate on them: True, so objects
28)how is an array passed as an argument by default: passed by reference and may be changed in a function, if not desire for mutators, put a constant before it
29)when you have a construtor that doesnt require any arguments: default constructor
30)when you have a destructor, what symbol do you use: ~ tilde 
31) when you declare your funcion outside of a class, what symbol is used: "::", scope resolution
32)when you have more than one array that is related to each other through positions of the elements: parallel arrays
33)whats the difference between ascending and decending: small to big, big to small
34)whats an inline function and what can be called in it: its with a class, short and put inside the class definition
35)when you create an object: you create an instance of the object
36)What is abstraction: A concept to create a general model of something
