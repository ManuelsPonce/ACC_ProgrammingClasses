	23)Main memory (RAM) is usually volatile type of memory that is used only for 
		temporary storage while a program is running. When turned off the RAM is erased.
		Secondary memory is a type of memory that can hold data for long periods of
		time - even when there is no powerto the computer.
	24)System software are programs that control and manage the basic operations of a 
		computer. Application software are programs that make a computer useful for everyday tasks.
		These are the programs that people normally spend most of their time running on their computers.
	25)Syntax error is any error in the rules that must be followed to cunstruct a program
		(Key wordss, Punctuation, Operator). A Logical Error is an error that gives incorrect 
		results because it carried out tasks incorrectly.
